    <h1>Class Product Proposal - DishDelish</h1>

    <p1>I will be creating a web app that allows a user to input available ingredients and the app will return a recipe that may be made with available ingredients.</p1>
    <br>
    <h2>Technology Overview</h2>
    <p2>I believe I will be able to utilize Python and its available libraries in order to make this idea work.</p2>
    <br>
    <h2>Feature List</h2>
    <p2>I believe at the least I can create a couple of recipes as variables and through an input of ingredients, a message stating if you can make the recipe or not would be printed.</p2>
    <br>
    <h2>Future Feature List</h2>
    <p2>This is where we'll see if I can incorporate hundreds of possible recipes with a specific number of ingredients and based on what the user inputs will display possible recipes that they can create.</p2>
